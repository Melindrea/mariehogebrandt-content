## Tracking

I use Google Analytics to track users behaviour on this site. This also includes using [display features](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357) to profile the demographics with gender (unfortunately it's binary), age span and interests. **This can not be used to track a specific user**.

I have also set up so that the IP address is anonymized. This means that though Google Analytics does get access to your graphical profile, the specific IP address *is not stored*. For details, I recommend [Google's help page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en).

If you are not interested at all in disclosing your specific surfing habits, I strongly recommend activating the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

I live in Swe­den and work at [Pineberry](http://www.pineberry.com) in Stock­holm as a devel­oper (mainly PHP/WordPress, some Python) since 2012.

In my spare time I explore the new and cool things that pop up every so often, dis­card some fairly soon, though oth­ers stick with me. I am a bit of an inspi­ra­tion but­ter­fly, and jump from project to project aim­lessly. I will write for a month or two, then do dig­i­tal art for a month or two, pick up the redesign of my page for the umpteenth time, etc. Unfor­tu­nately these but­ter­fly ten­den­cies are paired with a cer­tain amount of per­fec­tion­ism, which is one of the rea­sons I lose inter­est: If I can’t get some­thing as awe­some as I want it to be, I just stop.
